1. To add cpp library and use them to ESP IDF
	a. add "extern "C" {void app_main(void);}"
	b. change the main.c to main.cpp
	c. all cpp methods/task now need to be void and declared as "sometask(void*)"
	d. no task/method initialization, all methods should have {}

2. Eclipse IDE no auto save (TODO), remember to save before building

3. The ESP-IDF does not support "Modbus TCP/IP" slave or master!
	I need to create the component myself (:
	I look for another solution
		MQTT needs a broker (Not Good)
		We use sockets ??

4. Modify the droneController app to work with both Modbus and Sockets, the user to choose??? 

5. I2c doesn't work well with breadboards using IDF, took me two days to surrender/realize. It worked well with Arduino but with IDF, the connections need to be very well (no Debouncing issues, I guess). But, I will not look any further on the problem. The error that I got was 
"Block write verification error, bank 
bank 7, address 126!
Expected:0x30
Received:0x14"

-I solved by connecting MPU and ESP with a female-female wire connector. Each end at the respective terminal, no Breadboard used, I still get errors when I shake the connections as they are kinda loose :). Off to the next one.
